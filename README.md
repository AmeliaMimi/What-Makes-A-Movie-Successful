## 🧠 What I Did

- Loaded a raw CSV of TMDB movie metadata (title, genre, runtime, budget, popularity, ratings, and more)
- Cleaned and transformed messy columns for consistency and readability
- Converted budget, runtime, and popularity into numeric formats
- Visualized patterns across genres, release years, and performance metrics using Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Explored which features correlate most with audience ratings and popularity

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- Action and adventure genres consistently appear in high-popularity movies
- Movies between 90–120 minutes tend to score higher in average viewer ratings
- Budget and vote average showed only modest correlation — big money doesn’t guarantee success
- Certain release years showed spikes in both quantity and quality — possibly tied to industry trends

---

## 🔧 Tools Used

- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Jupyter Notebook**: for analysis, visualization, and documentation
- Markdown: for readable project notes
